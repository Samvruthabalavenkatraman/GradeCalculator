# GradeCalculator
The calculate_grade() function takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on a set of criteria.
The user is prompted to input their score.
The input score is validated to ensure it falls within the valid range of 0 to 100.
If the score is valid, the program calculates the grade using the calculate_grade() function and prints it out.
